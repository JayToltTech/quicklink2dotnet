# QuickLinkDotNet #

**Quick Link 2 version 2.5.1.0 (released Aug 8, 2012) is now supported.**

### Summary ###
QuickLinkDotNet is a Microsoft .NET wrapper written in C# for the Quick Link eye tracker software API from [EyeTech Digital Systems, Inc.](http://www.eyetechds.com/)

### Requirements ###
  * An eye tracker from [EyeTech Digital Systems, Inc.](http://www.eyetechds.com/)
  * Microsoft _Visual Studio_ 2010
  * The [Quick Link 2](https://www.eyetechds.com/support.shtml?page=link_link) eye tracking software API.

### License ###
The QuickLinkDotNet wrapper is completely free and licensed under the very permissive [MIT software license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  Therefore, it is suitable for use in any project--including commercial applications.

## Downloads ##
  * The wrapper can be downloaded from **[Main](https://code.google.com/p/quicklinkapi4net/downloads/list)** download site, or the **[Alternate](https://googledrive.com/host/0BzxvObLklhNkNWlHZjBBZWdhSXM)** download site.
  * The **[SVN source code repository](https://code.google.com/p/quicklinkapi4net/source/checkout)** is the place to look for any potential "bleeding edge" changes that have not been officially released yet, but you probably don't need to worry about those.

### Quick Link 1 vs. Quick Link 2 ###
The old **Quick Link 1** is supported; however, the wrapper for **Quick Link 1** comes in _a separate download package_.  See the **Downloads** section (above) for links to the download locations.  Be sure to choose the version you need.

### Documentation ###
  * The primary documentation for **Quick Link 2** wrapper is provided in the form of Microsoft help files, which can be found in the _Docs\_ directory of the wrapper package.  Meanwhile, the main API documentation for the old **Quick Link 1** wrapper exist in the form of source code comments.
  * The **Quick Link 2** wrapper also includes _IntelliSense_ documentation.  This means that handy information about each API call will appear in pop up bubbles as you type code in _Visual Studio_!
  * Also, see the _README.txt_ in the main directory of each wrapper package for additional information.

### Special Thanks ###
  * To the [University of Alaska Anchorage Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/mathematicalsciences/) for allowing me to use an EyeTech TM3 eye tracker to get this project started.
  * To [EyeTech Digital Systems, Inc.](http://www.eyetechds.com/) for generously lending me an EyeTech TM3 eye tracker, which allows me to keep this wrapper updated.
  * To Caleb Hinton, Brianna Peters, Maulik Mistry, and everyone else at [EyeTech Digital Systems, Inc.](http://www.eyetechds.com/) for their continuing help and technical support, and for their code contributions (see individual files for specific credits).
